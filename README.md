# Condensation Dynamics on Metal Plates

This project experimentally investigates the condensation dynamics on copper and aluminum metal surfaces with smooth and finned geometries using a thermoelectric Peltier cooler to control surface temperature below the dew point.

## Project Overview

Condensation occurs when water vapor transforms into liquid droplets upon contact with a cooler surface. This study examines the rate of condensation on different metal surfaces and their effects on heat transfer using controlled thermal conditions.

## Objectives

- Measure and compare the condensation rates on smooth and finned copper and aluminum surfaces.
- Analyze condensation heat flux and water collection mass during controlled temperature variations.
- Understand how surface geometry and material affect condensation behavior.
- Evaluate condensation dynamics under various controlled thermal and humidity conditions.

## Experimental Setup

- Thermoelectric Peltier cooler to create controlled cooled surface.
- Heat sink and fan to dissipate heat from hot side of Peltier device.
- Humidifier to maintain moisture-rich environment.
- Thermocouples to monitor surface temperature.
- Petri dish to collect condensed water droplets.
- Variable DC voltage source to power Peltier cooler.
- MDF and acrylic panels to assemble stable enclosure and setup structure.

## Methodology

- Assembly of cooling setup with precise thermal contact and enclosure.
- Gradual cooling of test surfaces below dew point.
- Measurement of ambient and surface temperature, humidity, and condensed water mass over time.
- Repeated experiments for each sample surface with varying temperature and humidity conditions.
- Analysis of condensation rate, heat flux, and effect of airflow generated by fans.

## Key Results

- Finned aluminum surfaces showed significantly higher condensation rates and heat flux due to increased surface area.
- Lower surface temperatures consistently produced higher condensation rates.
- Copper and flat aluminum surfaces exhibited similar condensation performance.
- Generated airflow from fans increased condensation rate and water collection.
- No formation of continuous condensate film observed due to environmental and surface conditions.

## Challenges and Limitations

- Variability in ambient conditions impacting experimental repeatability.
- Difficulty maintaining uniform surface temperature across samples.
- Manual handling caused intermittent disturbances in condensation collection.
- Limited availability of finned copper samples restricted data completeness.
- Setup stability and electrical supply control posed challenges.

## Future Work

- Develop sealed, climate-controlled chamber to stabilize humidity and temperature.
- Automate surface temperature control and real-time monitoring.
- Investigate passive cooling and hybrid condensation techniques for energy efficiency.
- Expand sample range and improve measurement automation.
